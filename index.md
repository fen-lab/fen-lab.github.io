We are a research group of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Regensburg. We investigate how neurobiological alterations manifest in psychopathological symptoms.

We utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), meta-analytical methods, and non-invasive brain stimulation methods for the experimental characterization and manipulation of psychopathological symptoms. Our research focuses on common psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, as well as acoustic phantom perceptions. We also investigate neurobiological changes that underlie forensically relevant disorders such as psychopathy.
